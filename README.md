# Water-Quality-Monitoring
This project automates the monitoring of aquatic ecosystems with Earth Observation to assess water quality. Using satellite imagery, it analyzes parameters like chlorophyll, turbidity, and suspended sediments, enabling efficient, real-time insights for ecosystem health management and pollution control.

# Data Sources
We will be using two satellites in this project: **Sentinel-2** and **MODIS Aqua**
- MODIS offers Higher temporal resolution images(2 revisit times per day) at the cost of a coarser spatial resolution (500m)
- Sentinel-2A offers finer spatial resolution(20m) at the cost of lower temporal resolution (5 day revisit time)

## Spectral Indices used for the Water Quality Monitoring

- **Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)**: Used to monitor changes in water content of water bodies.
- **Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI)**: Enhances open water features while efficiently suppressing and even removing built-up land noise as well as vegetation and soil noise.
- **Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI)**: Used to estimate the concentration of chlorophyll in water bodies.
- **Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI)**: Measures the cloudiness or haziness of water caused by large numbers of individual particles.
- **Dissolved Oxygen (DO)**: Indicates the amount of oxygen that is present in the water, essential for aquatic life.
- **pH**: Measures the acidity or alkalinity of water, important for aquatic organisms.
- **Chlorophyll-a Index**: Used to estimate the concentration of chlorophyll-a in water bodies.
- **Suspended Sediment Concentration (SSC)**: Estimates the concentration of suspended sediments in water bodies.
- **Water Surface Temperature (WST)**: Measures the temperature of the water surface, important for understanding various ecological processes.
