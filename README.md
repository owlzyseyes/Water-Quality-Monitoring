# Water-Quality-Monitoring
This project automates the monitoring of aquatic ecosystems with Earth Observation to assess water quality. Using satellite imagery, it analyzes parameters like chlorophyll, turbidity, and suspended sediments, enabling efficient, real-time insights for ecosystem health management and pollution control.

# Data Sources
We will be using two satellites in this project: Sentinel-2 and MODIS Aqua
- MODIS offers Higher temporal resolution images(2 revisit times per day) at the cost of a coarser spatial resolution (500m)
- Sentinel-2A offers finer spatial resolution(20m) at the cost of lower temporal resolution (5 day revisit time)

# Spectral Indices used for the Water Quality Monitoring
